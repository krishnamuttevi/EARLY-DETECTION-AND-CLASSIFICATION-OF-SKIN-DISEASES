# 🧬 EARLY DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SKIN DISEASES

The rise of dermatological conditions, combined with the increasing demand for efficient and scalable diagnostic solutions, has highlighted the need for intelligent tools in healthcare.  
This project introduces a **web-based application** designed for the **early detection and classification of skin diseases** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

The system assists healthcare professionals and individuals by identifying common skin conditions through automated image analysis.
